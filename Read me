For this challenge, I have automated the acceptance tests for login page. 
The tests are written as Specflow scenarios, implemented using C# and powered by Selenium & Nunit. 
I have used "Page Object" design pattern to decouple the page elements, which are prone to changes. 

To run the test, please follow the below instructions:
  i. clone the repository to your local,
  ii. Open the solution with Visual Studio
  iii. Add Specflow, Selenium and Nunit extensions 
  iv. Build the solution 
  v. Run the tests from Test Explorer 

Note: You will notice that 2 tests are failing because of the invalid login credentials. Please update the scenario with proper credentials.
